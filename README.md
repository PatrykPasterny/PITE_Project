Fancy GUI for Fluka to Root Converter

Team leader: Patryk Pasterny

Team members : Marcin Pajka, Kamil Piastowicz, Krzysztof Romanowski


To use FLOOT_2-1.py it have to be into one file with sf2rconverter then you just have to type down:
python FLOOT_2-1.py
and use GUI like it is described in instruction and HELP bar inside FLOOT. 
In case of emergency mail me:
patryk.jan.pasterny@cern.ch 

Of course you can still open sf2rconverter from terminal if you only want. It is console application used by FLOOT to conversion.
