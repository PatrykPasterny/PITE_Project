To use gui.py it have to be into one file with sf2rconverter then you just have to type down:
python gui.py
and select file inside the GUI to see all histograms which we are getting now from sf2rconverter(histograms for all angles and superposition of them). 


Businessplan:

1) Build basic GUI                                                                            DONE

2) Change sf2r_lib to make a tree which has branches labeled like detectors                   DONE
