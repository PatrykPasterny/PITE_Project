Fancy GUI for Fluka to Root Converter

Team leader: Patryk Pasterny

Team members : Marcin Pajka, Kamil Piastowicz, Krzysztof Romanowski

To use gui.py it have to be into one file with sf2rconverter then you just have to type down:
python gui.py
and select file inside the GUI to see three histograms which we are getting now from sf2rconverter(two histograms into different angles 
and the superposiotion of them). It is of course just a basic part of our project we are waiting for feedback.

Businessplan:

1) Build basic GUI                                                                            DONE
2) Change sf2r_lib to make a tree which has branches labeled like detectors                   DONE
3) Write functions which change root canvas into tk canvas                                    DONE
4) Write tests for 1DPLOT part of sf2r_lib.py                                                 DONE
5) Run basic GUI( builded up thanks to points 1-4.)                                           DONE
6) Build a tree in our GUI(see point 2.)                                                      IN PROGRESS
7) New features of GUI                                                                        IN PROGRESS

Of course you can still open sf2rconverter from terminal if you only want.
